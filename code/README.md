## 1. Variables

* Three ways of declaration of variables
    * const
    * let
    * var
* `const` is used for a variable not being changed.
* `let` and `var` is used for a variable being changed.
* `var` declaration is **legacy**, so consider using `const` or `let` instead of `var`.

## 2. Data Types

* There're NO data types for variables, but value itself has data types.
    * primitive
        * you can't change it after making
        * 7 types: Boolean, Number, Bigint, String, undefined, null, Symbol
    * object
        * you can change it after making
        * e.g. Object, Array, Function, Class, Regular Expression, Date
